                             PHOSPHOR ENGINE
                                by Mibi88

Phosphor Engine is small engine to create text adventures. It is made up of a
rv32i emulator (if it can be called an emulator, a conversion tool to generate
the text adventure data and the engine code.

I created it for the js13k game jam 2025 but I'm not sure if I'll be able to
make a game with it before the deadline.

The engine code is in the game folder.

    BUILDING

Building requires a UNIX-like environment.

First of all, you need a llvm toolchain. It can be installed like this on
Fedora:

# dnf install llvm clang


Here is a complete list of the dependencies:

 - bash
 - the GNU coreutils obviously
 - java (not required when passing the -d flag)
 - imagemagick (when passing the -i flag)
 - clang/llvm

If I forgot to list a dependency, please file an issue.

Then, just run the build script:

$ ./build.sh

and it should download all the necessary files and make a build of the game.

You can pass the -d flag to make a debug build and the -f flag to force
redownloading all the dependencies.

You can pass the -i flag to store the game binary in an image.

    RUNNING IT

To test it you can just run

$ python -m http.server

in the build folder. Then just go to the address shown in the terminal and you
should be able to play the text adventure!
