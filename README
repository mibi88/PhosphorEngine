                        MIBI'S TEXT ADVENTURE ENGINE
                                by Mibi88

Mibi's Text Adventure Engine (MTAE) is small engine to create text adventures.
It is made up of a rv32i emulator (if it can be called an emulator, a
conversion tool to generate the text adventure data and the engine code.

The engine code is in the game folder.

    BUILDING

Building requires a UNIX-like environment.

First of all, you need a llvm toolchain. It can be installed like this on
Fedora:

# dnf install llvm clang

Then, just run the build script:

$ ./build.sh

and it should download all the necessary files and make a build of the game.

You can pass the -d flag to make a debug build and the -f flag to force
redownloading all the dependencies.

    RUNNING IT

To test it you can just run

$ python -m http.server

in the build folder. Then just go to the address shown in the terminal and you
should be able to play the text adventure!
